# Async AMQP Messaging
Development of a Java (Spring) library which expands the current Spring AMQP components.

It has support for:
* Communication
* Endpoint control
* Status control
* Logging for muliple logsystems
* Monitoring through Zabbix
* Message Types
* Highly Available and Failover
* Callbacks

Use of this component/library in your project should make it easier to communicate between clients.

If your thinking about using this library in your next project feel free to use it as you like. Feel free to inform me about the details :D .

Dependencies

First of all the library has to be build using Java 1.8.
This dependency comes with the use of [Lambda Expressions](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/Lambda-QuickStart/index.html#overview) which require JDK 8.

The library makes use of some Maven dependencies.
All are listed below.

| Name          | Version        |
| ------------- |:--------------:|
| Spring Rabbit | 1.4.3.RELEASED |
| SLF4J API     | 1.7.10         |

Throughout the development of the project this list may grow.
